My name is Vlad and I'm 22. Passionate about breaking bits and yelling at a debugger.

Feel free to buy me a coffee if you find whatever is around here interesting/inspiring so I make my mom not complain so much of the fact that I'm unployed and I don't make any money.(https://www.buymeacoffee.com/NVPVRxK1BP)

Otherwise if you wanna reach me you can reach me on twitter(@f00fc7c800) in case you wanna say hi or you don't understand something :)

As a short description of what you might encounter here : exploit dev research, malware analysis write-ups or god know's what i find interesting/amusing/worth to waste time. 
Currently I'm working on windows security stuff and in the same time learning about it :). Future stuff will include MacOs
Thank you for stopping by. 

Have a great day, and don't forget 



Hack the Planet!:)
